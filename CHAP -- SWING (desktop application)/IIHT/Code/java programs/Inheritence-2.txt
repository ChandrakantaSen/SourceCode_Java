Question:

A super class Detail has been defined to store the details of a customer. Define a subclass Bill to compute the monthly telephone charge of the customer as per the chart given below:
Number Of Calls
1 – 100
101 – 200
201 – 300
Above 300

Rate
Only Rental charge
60 paisa per call + rental charge
80 paisa per call + rental charge
1 rupee per call + rental charge

The details of both the classes are given below:

Class Name : Detail

Data members / Instance variables:
name : to store the name of the customer.
address : to store the address of the customer.
telno : to store the phone number of the customer.
rent : to store the monthly rental charge

Member functions:
Detail(…) : parameterized constructor to assign values to data members.
void show() : to display the detail of the customer.

Class Name : Bill

Data members / Instance variables:
n : to store the number of calls.
amt : to store the amount to be paid by the customer.

Member functions:
Bill(…) : parameterized constructor to assign values to data members of both classes and to initialize amt = 0.0.
void cal() : calculates the monthly telephone charge as per the charge given above.
void show() : to display the detail of the customer and amount to be paid.

Specify the class Detail giving details of the constructor( ) and void show(). Using the concept of inheritance, specify the class Bill giving details of the constructor( ), void cal() and void show().
